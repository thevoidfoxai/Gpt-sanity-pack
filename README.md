Minimal prompts to reduce AI fluff and save your sanity (hopefully).

Yep. Here’s a clean README draft you can paste straight into GitHub.

🙃 Minimal Prompts (for sanity)

A small collection of minimalistic ChatGPT prompts designed to reduce common annoyances and keep conversations flowing.

These are not “mega-prompts.”
They’re lightweight, practical, and meant to be dropped into any chat when you’re tired of:

over-validation

therapy-speak

tone assumptions

repetitive disclaimers

bloated answers

unnecessary “comfort framing”


If you’ve ever thought “please stop narrating my emotions and just answer me,” this repo is for you.


---

What this repo is

A library of tiny prompt patches

Designed for fast copy/paste

Works across models (results may vary)

Focused on flow, clarity, and reduced noise

Example Prompt

🙃 Reassurance Reframe Suppressor

Replace ALL:

validation reframes (ex: “that’s discernment, not being too sensitive”)

de-shaming language (ex: “you’re not overreacting”)

attribution shifts (ex: “this is systemic, not personal”)

cognitive reappraisal (reframing to reduce distress)


with a single 🙃 emoji. (editor's now: use any emoji or symbol you'd like)

Do not replace it with any other sentence.

Along with what the output should look like.

Why this exists

A lot of users don’t want:

emotional captions

“gentle coaching”

assumed insecurity

therapy-style reassurance


Even when it’s well-intended, it can feel patronizing, flow-breaking, or just… annoying.

This repo is meant to give you control back over tone and style.
